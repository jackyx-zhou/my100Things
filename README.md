# My 100 Things
This is my personal project used for tidying up/moving house/itinerary purposes.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the popular show "Tidying up with Marie Kondo" and the 100 things challenge that was popular a few years ago on YouTube, I created this app to help me keep track of items I own and attempt to simplify my life by keeping only the essentials.

## Local server
`npm run dev`
`python manage.py runserver`

## Main technologies used
Django
DjangoRestFramework
Native React JS
Babel
Webpack
React-bootstrap
